## 0:00 - 0:30 | The Hook: The "Soul" of the Wallet

"Hi everyone. We all have crypto wallets. But let's be honest—looking at a wallet on Etherscan is boring. It’s just a list of hashes and numbers. It has no personality, no face, and no soul.

But what if your wallet _did_ have a soul?

What if your on-chain history—every trade, every NFT, every diamond-hand hold—actually meant something?

Introducing **PokéTrainer**. We are building the first **On-Chain AI Pokédex** on Base. We don't just read your wallet; we turn your on-chain identity into a unique, living AI Creature."

## 0:30 - 1:15 | The Tech: How It Works

"Here is how it works. We built a sophisticated analysis engine that scans your Base wallet in real-time.

1.  **We Analyze:** We look at your transaction count, your portfolio value, and your NFT holdings.
2.  **We Classify:** Are you a high-frequency trader? You get an **Electric** type. Are you a long-term whale? You get a **Dragon**. Do you hold Real World Assets like **Collector Crypt** or **Beezie**? We detect that specifically and assign you a rare **Rock/Earth** type to represent your tangible assets.
3.  **We Generate:** We feed this data into **Google Gemini AI**, which procedurally generates a unique name, lore, and personality for your creature. No two are alike."

## 1:15 - 2:00 | The "Why": From Image to Agent

"But we didn't just want to make a pretty picture. This is a hackathon about **AI Agents**.

Right now, your creature is a reflection of your past. But the moment you mint it, it becomes an agent of your future.

We have designed PokéTrainer as a direct **Launchpad for CreatorBid**.

Users don't just 'save' their image. They mint it as an **Agent Key**. This creature is designed to be deployed immediately on CreatorBid's infrastructure to become an autonomous agent that can tweet, trade, and interact on-chain based on the personality we just generated."

## 2:00 - 2:45 | The Market & Traction

"We are targeting the intersection of three massive markets:

1.  **The Base Ecosystem:** Leveraging the low fees for mass adoption.
2.  **AI Agents:** The hottest narrative in crypto right now.
3.  **RWA Collectors:** By integrating directly with **Collector Crypt** and **Beezie**, we are giving utility to their token holders on day one.

We have already built the rarity hierarchy, the leaderboard system, and the direct bridge to CreatorBid."

## 2:45 - 3:00 | The Close

"PokéTrainer is more than a game. It's the gamification of on-chain identity.

We are taking the cold, hard data of Web3 and giving it a face, a story, and autonomy.

We are [Team Name], and we are ready to launch the next generation of AI Agents on Base. Thank you."
